Since the advent of type hints in Python 3.5, statically typing a DataFrame has generally been limited to specifying just the type:

    def process(f: DataFrame) -> Series: ...

This is insufficient, as it ignores the types contained within the container. A DataFrame might have an integer index, string column labels, and two floating-point columns: these characteristics are necessary to define the type.

StaticFrame 2 offers complete generic specification of a DataFrame, including the index, columns, and a variable number of columnar types. All core StaticFrame containers now support generic specification. While statically checkable, a new decorator, ``@CallGuard.check``, permits run-time validation of these type hints on function interfaces. Using ``Annotated`` generics, the new ``Require`` class defines a family of powerful run-time validators, permitting per column or per row analysis in addition to a host of other validations. Finally, each container exposes a new ``via_type_clinic`` interface to derive type hints at run time or validate a type hint. Together, these tools offer one of the first cohesive and integrated approaches to typing DataFrames.


## The Path to a Generic DataFrame

Python's built-in generic types (e.g.,``tuple`` or ``dict``) require specification of component types. Defining component types for such containers permits more accurate static analysis. While the same is true for DataFrames, there have been few attempts to comprehensively type hint DataFrames.

Pandas, even with the ``pandas-stubs`` package, does not permit specifying the types of a DataFrame's components. The Pandas DataFrame, permitting extensive in-place mutation, may not even be sensible to statically type. Fortunately, immutable DataFrames are available in StaticFrame.

Beyond mutability, Python's tools for defining generics have limited fully type hinting DataFrames. A key aspect of a DataFrame is that it has a variable number of columns of heterogenous types. Typing such a structure became much easier with the new ``TypeVarTuple``, introduced in Python 3.11

A ``TypeVarTuple`` permits creating generics that accept a variable number of types. (See PEP 646 https://peps.python.org/pep-0646). StaticFrame can then define a generic ``Frame`` with a ``TypeVar`` for the index, a ``TypeVar`` for the columns, and a ``TypeVarTuple`` for zero or more columnar types. A generic ``Series`` can be defined as a ``TypeVar`` for the index and a ``TypeVar`` for the values. The StaticFrame ``Index`` and ``IndexHierarchy`` are also generic, the latter taking advantage of ``TypeVarTuple`` to define a component ``Index`` per depth level.

For defining columnar types of a ``Frame``, or the values of a ``Series`` or ``Index``, NumPy generic types are used. For example, ``np.int_`` can be used to type a platform-default integer size, while ``np.int64`` can be used to type an explicit, 64-bit integer.


## Interfaces Defined with DataFrame Generics

Using generic specifications, the same interface from above can be annotated to show a ``Frame`` with three columns being transformed into a dictionary of ``Series``.

def process(f: Frame[
        Any,
        Index[np.str_],
        np.int_,
        np.str_,
        np.float64,
        ]) -> dict[int, Series[IndexYearMonth, np.float64]]: ...


The type hints in this interface offer so much more information we might intuit what the function does. This function processes a signal table from an Open Source Asset Pricing (https://www.openassetpricing.com) dataset (Firm Level Characteristics / Full Sets / Predictors / PredictorsIndiv). The table has three columns: security identifier ("permno"), year and month ("yyyymm"), and signal name.

The function ignores the index (typed as ``Any``) and creates groups defined by the first column "permno" ``np.int_`` values. For each group, a ``Series`` is returned of the ``np.float64`` values, the index an ``IndexYearMonth`` created from the ``np.str_`` "yyyymm" column.

Rather than returning a ``dict``, the function above might be revised to return a ``Series`` with a hierarchical index. The ``IndexHierarchy`` generic specifies a component ``Index`` for each depth level; as is clear, the outer depth is an ``Index[np.int_]``, the inner depth an ``IndexYearMonth``.

def process(f: Frame[
        Any,
        Index[np.str_],
        np.int_,
        np.str_,
        np.float64,
        ]) -> Series[IndexHierarchy[Index[np.int_], IndexYearMonth], np.float64]: ...


Combined with a better function name (e.g., ``partition_by_permno``), such rich type-hints provide an interface that makes the functionality explicit.

Even better, these type hints can be used for static analysis with Pyright (now) and MyPy (pending full ``TypeVarTuple`` support). Calling such a function with a ``Frame`` of two columns of ``np.float64``, for example, will fail a static analysis type check or deliver a warning in your editor.


## Runtime Validation


Static type checking might not be enough: runtime evaluation provides even stronger constraints, even for incomplately typed values.

StaticFrame 2 introduces a built-in decorator, ``@CallGuard.check``, that uses the same type hints for runtime validation. Extended with one or more validators enclosed in an `Annotated` generic, additional run-time validation of shape, labels, or arbitrary functional checks can be included.

Mom12m.csv: permno	yyyymm	Mom12m
Mom6m.csv: permno	yyyymm	Mom6m
LRreversal.csv: permno	yyyymm	LRreversal



In this case, we are taking a ``Frame`` of three columns, from a table inc


@check_interface
def process(f: Frame[
        IndexHierarchy[IndexDate, Index[np.int64]],
        Annotated[Index[np.str_], Labels(('height', 'frequency))],
        Annotated[np.float64, Validator(lambda s: (s > 0).all())],
        np.float64,
        ]) -> Series[IndexDate, np.float64]: ...

The number of combinations of the types of these components, even with just a few columns, is astronomical.


The Pandera library permits specifying columnar schema that can be used as a type-hint stand-in for the Pandas DataFrame type.

### first internal presentation

A goal of StaticFrame is to provide an explicit interface that supports creating maintainable libraries using DataFrames. As Python standard library tools for typing have evolved, using type hints to make DataFrame interfaces explicit and statically checkable is now (nearly!) possible.

NumPy has made substantial effort to implement typing for n-dimensional arrays. The challenge of typing n-dimensional arrays is different than for DataFrames: while an array instance might be of any dimensionality and shape while having a single dtype, a DataFrame has indices on the rows and columns, is always two-dimensional, and has zero or more columnar dtypes.

Specifying shape for n-dimensional arrays is complex; there are numerous proposals for such a specification. DataFrames do not need the complexity of an n-dimensional shape type. As DataFrames are always two-dimensional, and columnar types bear the greatest relevance for interfaces, we can forgo full shape types and instead focus on columnar types.

PEP 646 introduces `TypeVarTuple`, a new construct (included in Python 3.11) that supports variadic generics. With the `TypeVarTuple`, the columnar types of a DataFrame can be specified as all float, four columns of Booleans, or any other defined mixture. Combined with generic specifications for index type, column type, and variadic columnar types, DataFrames can be statically typed to meet the needs of most interfaces.

In CR today we will review NumPy's approach to typing, including the as-of-yet undefined generic shape type and the heavy use of overrides to permit type-specific return values where possible. Next, I will introduce `TypeVarTuple` and the benefits of variadic generics. Then, we will see how multiple inheritance with `Generic` can be used to make `Index`, `IndexHierarchy`, `Series`, and `Frame` generic, and how, with `TypeVarTuple`, we can make columnar type specification variadic for `IndexHierarchy` and `Frame`. Finally, we will consider other `Frame` characteristics that might be combined with type hints to perform comprehensive run-time validations.
