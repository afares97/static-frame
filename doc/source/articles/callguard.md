As tools for Python type annotations have evolved, more complex data structures can be typed, providing improved readability and static analysis. Arrays and DataFrames, as complex containers, have only recently supported complete type annotations in Python. NumPy 1.20 introduced generic specification of arrays and dtypes. Building on NumPy's foundation, StaticFrame 2.0 introduced complete type specification of DataFrames, employing NumPy primitives and variadic generics. This article demonstrates practical approaches to fully type-hinting arrays and DataFrames, and shows how the same annotations can improve code quality with both static analysis and run-time validation.


## Type Hints Improve Code Quality

While Python's resources for typing are still evolving, their usage improves code quality. Instead of using variable names or comments to define types, code-object annotations provide readable, maintainable, and powerful tools for type specification. These type annotations can be used for static analysis with `mypy` or `pyright`.

Even better, the same annotations can be used for run-time validation. While Python has traditionally emphasized the benefits of duck-typing over run-time validation, when using arrays and DataFrames, run-time validation is often necessary. Further, it is possible to have correctly verified types that do not reflect run-time reality: using type annotations for run-time validation ensures alignment.

Many important typing utilities are only available with the most-recent versions of Python. Fortunately, the `typing-extensions` package back-ports standard library utilities for older versions of Python. Similarly, type checkers sometimes lag in support for features in already-released versions of Python.

For one example, by defining overloaded function definitions using `Literal` arguments to encode integer `axis` values, axis-specific return types can be specified. For another example, `TypeVarTuple` permits defining contiguous regions of uniform types, permitting expressive specifcation of a wide range of types.
