Out-Performing NumPy is Hard: When a C-Extension Might Deliver Better Performance

Out-Performing NumPy is Hard: Approaches to Writing C-Extensions


While it is well known that C-extensions can improve the performance of Python programs, writing C-extensions that improve the performance of NumPy array operations are different. Most NumPy functions already call highly optimized C routines, some of which take advantage of low-level processor optimizations. Writing C-extensions that out-perform NumPy is challenging: in most cases, just writing Python that calls NumPy is optimal. However, for routines that are of sufficiently narrow scope, there are opportunities.

This presentation offers principles to help determine if a routine, implemented as a C-extension, might outperform NumPy routines called from Python. Along the way, how to create a Python project that compiles C-extensions linking to NumPy will be demonstrated, and the basics of the NumPy C API will be introduced.

A narrow use-case of the ``np.nonzero()`` function will be implemented in C as an example: rather than returning all indices of all non-zero values (for all dtypes and dimensionalities), this function, ``first_true_1d()``, will return only the index of the first-encountered non-zero value (for one-dimensional Boolean arrays). The performance of this routine, and why it sometimes cannot out-perform ``np.nonzero()``, will be discussed.




Outline

The Challenge of Outperforming NumPy
    Core NumPy operations are implemented in C
    Some NumPy operations take advantages of low-level processor optimizations
    Just using NumPy in Python is often optimal
    A sufficiently narrow process might offer performance advantages

Creating a Python Project that Compiles C-extensions with NumPy
    Project setup with setup.py or pyproject.toml
    Including NumPy headers
    Calling ``import_array()``

The Python C API and the NumPy C API
    Common naming conventions
    Casting between ``PyObject`` v. ``PyArrayObject`` pointers
    Reference counting ``PyArrayObject``
    Reference stealing of ``PyArray_Descr``

Common Operations with the NumPy C API
    Creating a ``PyArray_Descr``
    Creating a ``PyArrayObject``
        ``PyArray_Empty()``
        ``PyArray_Zeros()``
    Getting basic array characteristics
        dtype
        Shape
        Dimensionality
        Data flags
            C / Fortran ordering
            Contiguity
    Reading / writing values from / to an array
        ``PyArray_GETITEM()``
        ``PyArray_GetPtr()``
    Array data as a C array
        ``PyArray_DATA()``
        ``NpyIter``

Anti-Patterns when Creating NumPy C-Extensions
    Ignoring early performance comparisons
    Reimplementing what NumPy has already done
    Creating arrays from Python objects

Opportunities for Performance Advantage
    Bulk of operations happen in C
    Can treat array data as a C array
        Using ``PyArray_DATA`` for reading and writing
    Can simplify what NumPy is doing
        Limited dimensionality
        Supporting only a few types
        Requiring contiguity

Example C-Extension Implementation: ``first_true_1d()``
    Finding the first or last True in a Boolean array
    NumPy ``np.nonzero()`` does not short-circuit, returns an array
    NumPy ``np.argmax()`` does not distinguish case of no True

    Opportunity to simplify what NumPy is doing
        Can limit supported dimensions and dtypes
        Can require contiguity
        Can return just an integer
    Opportunity to operate on data as a C array
        Can quickly scan C array of Booleans
        No Python objects or reference counting needed

    Details of ``first_true_1d()`` implementation
        Parsing arguments
        Validating array requirements, raising exceptions
        Using ``PyArray_DATA`` to get a pointer
        Using pointer arithmetic to scan the array
        Returning a ``PyObject`` integer

Performance Evaluation of ``first_true_1d()``
    Can outperform ``np.nonzero()`` when there are many Trues
    When few Trues exist, ``np.nonzero()`` still outperforms
        Usage of loop unrolling
        Usage of Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) routines

Conclusion
    Outperforming NumPy, even in C, is hard
    There exist opportunities by finding narrow cases
    Performance tests must be done early and often
